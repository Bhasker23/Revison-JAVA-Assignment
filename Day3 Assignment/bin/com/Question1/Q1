Problem 1 :

Abstract Class : Identify The Output of following code


Part 1 : Check Whether the below code will execute or not. Give Reason with your answer

	abstract class AbstractAlgorithm{
		abstract void steps();
	}
	
	
	class Algorithm1 extends AbstractAlgorithm{
	}
	
	
Reason ->	This code will give us error because we are not overriding steps() method.
